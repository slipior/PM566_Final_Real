# PM566_Final

This project involves creating an interactive stacked bar chart to visualize various game metrics collected for the LA Galaxy U17 team during the 2022-2023 season. The data, derived from Catapult devices, includes metrics such as Total High Intensity Bouts, Total Sprints, and Total Explosive Efforts.

#### Implementation:

-   **Data Source**: The data is sourced from Catapult devices, used in sports performance monitoring. It includes metrics recorded during training sessions and games. Unfortunately, because the data is owned by the team, it cannot be made publicly available

-   **Tools Used**: The visualization is implemented using **`ggplot2`** for initial static plotting and **`plotly`** for enhancing interactivity.

-   **Interactivity**: Enhanced by **`plotly`**, users can interact with the chart to gain more insights. Hovering over segments shows detailed information about each metric.
